## After a long week of intense Next.js studying, I decided to spend Sunday morning working on a simple music player using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.  Nothing wrong with a little skill sharpening, plus you can always learn something new.  For instance, I learned more about the HTML5 audio element, and certain event listeners you can use to help administer that piece of audio.
